# Support

Reference workflow for support; inspect its boundaries before adapting any code.

> [!CAUTION]
> Demo and reference code only. This recipe is not a vetted production implementation. Independently review it, obtain authorization, and validate security, privacy, compliance, cost, and site-term requirements before use. Use at your own risk.

**Status:** legacy · source inspected.

**Recipe type:** reference.
**LLM requirement:** required (derived from the inspected framework and configuration metadata).

## Setup and run

Run from this directory. Commands come from the package manifest, upstream setup guide, or inspected entrypoint. Configure credentials before starting.

```sh
cd use-cases/sales-support-and-ops/browserbase/support
npm install
test -f .env || cp .env.example .env
```

No launch command was established. The linked source is a starting point for integration; do not assume that importing it is side-effect free.

## Caveats and verification

Source and setup metadata were inspected. No passing authenticated live-workflow check is recorded for this recipe. Websites, model access, paid services, permissions, costs, and operator-specific configuration remain unverified.

- The prompt asks for three results but the schema describes one object; multi-result output is not established. This is not a support-ticket workflow.
